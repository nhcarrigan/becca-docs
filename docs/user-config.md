# User Config

Becca offers a few settings you can use to personalise your individual experience with her commands.

## Level Card

In servers that have the levelling system enabled, you are able to view your current level and experience points with the `/community level` command. There are three settings to change here:

- `background`: This determines the background colour for your card.
- `foreground`: This determines the colour of the text, and the background colour of the progress bar.
- `progress`: This determines the completion colour of the progress bar.

These values need to be set as HEX strings, with or without the hash. `#aaaaaa` and `0F0F0F` would both be acceptable values.

In this example, the `background` value is `#3A3240`, the `foreground` value is `#AAEA8DE`, and the `progress` value is `#FFFFFF`.
